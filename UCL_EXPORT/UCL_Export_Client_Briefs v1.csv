Great work, and would definitely recommend.

One lesson I learned from the project was that Aviva tends to want to use Aviva approved UX research firms, when dealing with users / customers. We didn't understand this at the outset of the project, which introduced unexpected cost and delays (as we had to change from Shoreditch's original agency). The knock-on impact of the delay was that the project tripped over the intended end date, and into holiday season (and likely into other commitments Shoreditch had). It's meant the project has taken a while to reach concrete conclusion. This is a learning Aviva colleagues should take on board, so that we can better prepare for UX research, and in turn help both Aviva and our partners to better estimate costs and end dates.",10,10,,Ed Leigh

They were happy to work for us on risk until we completed the procurement process as not to jeopardise our critical timelines which was appreciated. An ask of our brief was to develop an innovate and market leading onboarding journey to support our internal strategy for growth and improve organic conversion. We asked this to be developed agnostic of our internal constraints so we could see a blue-sky journey to aspire to.  The team researched competitor journeys for us, provided side by side comparisons of questions we ask that competitors don't (to promote a more frictionless journey), gave recommendations on improved features (e.g. payment method) and provided high fidelity designs to pass onto our build teams. They also resolved blockages with lead times for consumer research and offered to facilitate this themselves, which i was supportive of and appreciated.  Considering the very tight window I considered the output to be of high quality.  They worked closely with SMEs on the Aviva side to deliver.
