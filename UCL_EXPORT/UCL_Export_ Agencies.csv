Their purpose.  But again and again they see that potential stifled by a lack of real executive commitment, or buried beneath ribbons of red tape.

Kevin and Andrew came together because they urgently believed in one thing above all else: that impact can only really happen with organisations who are prepared to embrace purpose as more than just an idea.  It must be seized as an opportunity for action. And that with bolder innovation, they could make impact happen smarter, faster.

Good Innovation is a tribe of expert innovators, entrepreneurs, designers, researchers and developers united by one mission.  To help organisations across the charity and corporate sectors break free from the constraints of ‘business-as-usual’ and complacency.  And to unleash the potential of their purpose and ambition to create real change.

We agitate for change and collaboration, and we obsess over our clients’ impact.  Only ever accepting the very best from ourselves and each other.

A consultancy built to guide purposeful organisations who are serious about making a difference.  To better our world with agility and authenticity.

The work isn’t easy.  Change never is.  But with our diverse team of experts behind you, you can go further.  You can achieve more.

Because purpose is nothing without impact.  And for a better tomorrow we have to make impact happen today.",Good Innovation
