We deliver actionable insights and design solutions embedded in real human stories.Since 2020, our team has competed with the best in the business, delivering outsized value to national and international clients including airlines, banks, fintechs, and retailers. Why do you need integrated research and design?Often, companies do their research work with one agency and their value proposition design with another. When one hand doesn't talk to the other, the opportunity falls to the floor (where it usually lands in a big pile of wasted time, money and effort).At Phase One we integrate mixed-methods market research, value proposition design, prototyping and user testing to create a throughline from early insights to ready-to-build solutions. Our unique process gives you the courage, confidence and certainty you need for new product success.We create videos, journey maps and other communication assets to help you activate insights, align your teams and get stakeholder buy-in along the way. We are laser-focused on using human-centred research and design to help our clients create winning value propositions. You'll walk away from an engagement with ready-to-build solutions that make a real difference in your customers’ lives.
